# AES-128-CBC-Handmade
Handmade AES 128 CBC algorithm of which supports encrytion of 16 characters.Started as a term project and then decided to upload it in github. perhaps it would be useful for someone.
Some parts of the code is poorly written due to my laziness and lack of knowledge of javascript at the moment. But you are free to change it. For encryption and decryption steps. I have uploaded a picture representing all steps occuring in algorithm. And By the way, I have written some parameters in foreign languages. Reason why is I was keep creating variables with same name and becoming out of name ideas.
